The application asks the healthcare worker for the patient's information, such as heart rate, temperature, and other information related to the patient's well-being, and the healthcare worker can assess the patient's condition and offer necessary treatment if needed. Sote-App is very convenient and easy to use, and it provides healthcare workers with the ability to offer the best possible care to their patients. It is an important tool for healthcare workers who want to provide efficient and high-quality care to their patients.",

          "My story with Virittämö Helsinki started before I even got hired. I first applied and didn't get the job, but thanks to the previous ICT team leaders advice, I studied cloud technologies more and applied again. Even though I still struggled with Finnish language in the interview, I got hired. At first I was pretty quiet, shy and unsure, but I got to work with one of our systems.",
          "I started to notice things we could improve, but I struggled about communicating. I shifted my focus to communication skills and language. I knew it wouldnt matter how well I can understand the systems if I can't make people to discuss about them. This way I got an opportunity to learn what I needed the most.\nEach week we had different team member responsible for certain weekly routines so everyone could practice presentation skills and help others. There were also advanced Finnish lessons and free courses from Metropolia University helping me to become more professional and healthy. I learned more job-seeking skills and even though I didn't find a suitable job for myself, many others did.",
          "I'm grateful for everyone I met at Virittämö. I learned so much during my time and I got very lucky with my first job experience. I saw with my own eyes, how people grew with this support and were able to achieve what they wanted in the end. Including me. Thank you Virittämö Helsinki. Life-changing for sure",

          "I graduated as a data clerk and then got into Oulu University of Applied Sciences to study information and communication technology. In the last year of my studies, I switched to the mobile gaming industry as a game designer and moved to Helsinki. After taking a break for a couple of years due to unfinished studies, I dreamt of a career as a programmer. By chance, I came across a job advertisement from Virittämö and got my first programming job. Virittämö's software team seemed like the perfect place to start in the desired position.",
          "I have nothing but good things to say about Virittämö. It was great to dive right into customer projects, where I was able to utilize what I had learned before. There wasn't too much pressure at work, and I had time to learn new programming languages. I learned a lot of new things and gained more confidence that I could implement client requests. I got a lot of help from other employees in joint projects. I feel that the social support network was good overall, and everyone helped each other.",
          "Next, I will return to Oulu to finish my university degree, so I can continue working as a programmer in the future. Virittämö helped me set clear goals, brought a sense of doing things, and a better rhythm to my daily life. I highly recommend Virittämö!",
