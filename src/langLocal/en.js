I received feedback from the ICT team leader that I would benefit from learning more about cloud computing and he encouraged me to apply again to Virittämo. I struggled with my Finnish during the interview, but eventually, I was offered the opportunity to work at Virittämo.",
          "At first, I was a bit shy, unsure and kept to myself. I started working around one IT system and to my delight I found myself developing and learning more and more. Unfortunately, I found it challenging to communicate and express my thoughts clearly in Finnish, and therefore decided to focus on honing my communication and language skills. I realized very soon that even if I would manage different systems, how well, the challenge was that I could not communicate effectively with my colleagues in Finnish.",
          "To improve my language skills, I was offered the opportunity to participate in a weekly language group at work, where I received Finnish language tuition. I received encouraging feedback from the work community. In addition, Metropolia University of Applied Sciences offered advanced Finnish language courses and free ICT courses to develop my professional skills. In addition to these, my job search skills improved, despite the fact that I did not immediately find a suitable job for myself during my stay at Viritus, although other colleagues did.",
          "I am very grateful for all the support and opportunities I received from Virittämö. I learned many new things and am happy to have had a positive work experience. I saw firsthand how people could grow and achieve their goals with the support of the whole organization, including myself.",

In the last year of my studies, I switched to the mobile gaming industry as a game designer and moved to Helsinki. After taking a break for a couple of years due to unfinished studies, I dreamt of a career as a programmer. By chance, I came across a job advertisement from Virittämö and got my first programming job. Virittämö's software team seemed like the perfect place to start in the desired position.",
          "I have nothing but good things to say about Virittämö. It was great to dive right into customer projects, where I was able to utilize what I had learned before. There wasn't too much pressure at work, and I had time to learn new programming languages. I learned a lot of new things and gained more confidence that I could implement client requests. I got a lot of help from other employees in joint projects. I feel that the social support network was good overall, and everyone helped each other.",
          "Next, I will return to Oulu to finish my university degree, so I can continue working as a programmer in the future. Virittämö helped me set clear goals, brought a sense of doing things, and a better rhythm to my daily life. I highly recommend Virittämö!",
